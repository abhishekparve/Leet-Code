"""
What is the purpose of the for loop?

For each job (d, p):

It tries to find the latest free slot on or before its deadline d.
If such a slot exists, the job is scheduled there.
This maximizes the chance that earlier slots remain available for other jobs with smaller deadlines.

This is a classic greedy scheduling technique.
"""
"""
Why do we try to assign each job to the latest available slot before its deadline?

We assign a job to the latest possible slot before its deadline to leave earlier slots open
for other jobs that must be done earlier (i.e. jobs with tighter deadlines). This increases 
the total number of jobs we can schedule, thereby potentially increasing total profit.

jobs = [(2, 100), (1, 50), (2, 20)]
Suppose we assign jobs to the earliest available slot, here's what might happen:

Job (2, 100) â†’ assign to slot 1 (earliest available)

Job (1, 50) â†’ slot 1 is taken â†’ cannot assign

Job (2, 20) â†’ assign to slot 2

âœ… Total jobs = 2, Profit = 100 + 20 = 120

Now Try Latest Slot First (Correct Greedy Strategy):
Job (2, 100) â†’ assign to slot 2 (latest possible)

Job (1, 50) â†’ assign to slot 1

Job (2, 20) â†’ no slot left â†’ can't assign

âœ… Total jobs = 2, Profit = 100 + 50 = 150

ðŸš€ Higher profit and same number of jobs.
