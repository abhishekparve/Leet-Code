        max_sum = 0
        # i = number of cards taken from the front
        # k - i = number of cards taken from the back
        # its basic arithmetic if you have to pick k elements
        # and if you pick i element at front then the remaining elements that
        # you have to pick will be (k - i)
        for i in range(k + 1):
            # Starting from zero pick every thing till "i" but exclude i index
            front = sum(cardPoints[:i])
            # So what is n - (k - i)?
            # It gives you the starting index of the last k - i cards in the array.
            # Letâ€™s break it down further:
            # 1. n is the total number of cards
            # 2. k - i is how many we want from the end
            # 3. n - (k - i) is the index where the last k - i cards start
            back = sum(cardPoints[n - (k - i) :])
            total = front + back
            max_sum = max(max_sum, total)
        return max_sum

    # Why the for loop is in the range k + 1 and not k?
    #  i_index        front pick     back pick (k - i)
    #     0              0               3
    #     1              1               2
    #     2              2               1
    #     3              3               0

    # If we did range(k), we would stop at k - 1 which is "2" index
    # and we would have missed all the cases where "k" cards are picked
    # from the front.
    # Intitution :
    # We are trying to split k picks between front and back
    # 1. from 0 front + k back
    # 2. to k front + 0 back
    # and that is exactly k + 1 combinations

    # TC = O(2k)

        # and from there we keep moving towards left k - 2, k - 3,..so on.
        # while decrementing from the front we also keep on adding the
        # same number of remove elements from the back i.e, n - 1, n- 2, n- 3
        # and so on.. (O(k))
